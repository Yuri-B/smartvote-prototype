# Participation is the key to real democracy #

Do you find it difficult to decide who to vote for in Elections?

Smartvote.ie will compare all the candidates for an election in a fair and totally independent way. This allows a voter to decide who to vote for, based on their own views. We have no affiliation to any political party.

Are you tired of not having your say in major Dáil decisions, that affect your life?

Smartvote will allow users to vote on important decisions before the official Dáil Vote. TDs will know exactly how their constituents want them to vote. The TD will then has to decide whether to truly represent their constituents or to follow the party whip.

Smartvote are developing a platform that will allow Direct Participatory Democracy for everyone.
